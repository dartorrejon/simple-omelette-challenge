## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom fonts: _@font-face_
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned to use "font-face", which allows me to add fonts that I had in a local folder. I also put into practice the use of grid and flex to align the page.

I add some code snippets in the section below as an example of the work done:

```html
 <section class="nutrition">
        <h2 class="nutrition-title">Nutrition</h2>
        <p> The table below shows nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings.</p>
        <div class="nutrition-table">
          <div class="nutrition-values">
            <div>Calories</div>
            <div>277kcal</div>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div class="nutrition-values">
            <div>Carbs</div>
            <div>0g</div>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div class="nutrition-values">
            <div>Protein</div>
            <div>20g</div>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div class="nutrition-values">
            <div>Fat</div>
            <div>22g</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
```
```css
@font-face{
    font-family: 'Outfit';
    src: url(./assets/fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}
@font-face{
    font-family: 'Young Serif';
    src: url(./assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf) format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}
```
### Continued development


I would like to continue improving in CSS, I know I learned a lot this time but there are many more things that I want to improve, such as @keyfreames or @media queries. I would also like to implement BEM (_Block-Element-Modifier_) methodology in the future.
